Hi hi! I’m Qiao, an astronomer studying galaxy formation and evolution using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). I’m especially interested in:

- **Galaxy Stellar Populations** and **Star-Forming Properties**
- **Galaxy Mergers** and their role in galaxy mass assembly, as well as merger-driven <u>star formation</u> and <u>AGN activity</u>
- Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting — I’m currently co-developing a new mode of the Prospector SED fitting code, **Prospector-γ**, with my Ph.D. advisor, [Professor Sandro Tacchella](https://www.tacchella.space).
