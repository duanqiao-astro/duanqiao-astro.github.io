Hi hi! I’m Qiao — an astronomer studying galaxy formation and evolution with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), working with [Professor Sandro Tacchella](https://www.tacchella.space) and [Professor Roberto Maiolino](https://www.robertomaiolino.net/). I am also a member of the JWST [JADES](https://jades-survey.github.io/) and [PEARLS](https://sites.google.com/view/jwstpearls) teams.

I'm especially interested in:

- **Galaxy Stellar Populations** and **Star-Forming Properties**
- **Galaxy Mergers**, including pair fractions, merger rates, and their role in galaxy mass assembly, as well as merger-driven <u>Star Formation</u> and <u>AGN Activity</u>
- **Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting** — I’m currently co-developing a new mode of the Prospector SED fitting code, **Prospector-γ**, with Sandro.

I did my four-year Undergraduate Master's degree at the University of Manchester, where I had the great opportunity to join [Professor Christopher Conselice](https://sites.google.com/view/cconselice/home?authuser=0)'s EPOCHS research group. During that time, I developed a deep fascination with Galaxies 💫
